    <h1> My testimony </h1>

    <p class="Mytestimony">
        In this laboratory act, we were tasked to make a web page using embedded CSS and HTML  with multimedia menu bar navigation.
        Our teacher taught us how to make it , she gave us a lot of information and we were grateful for it, then I started making it
        and I was having a great time because I know how to make it somehow , but during the process i had a little problem, i forgot some of the things to do.
        But eventually I remembered it did it, but I still have some doubt in myself because I still lack a lot of knowledge. But i'll study more and 
        watch a lot of tutorial videos so that I will be able to know stuff that i didn't know. Then when I was done , I then typed my testimony which I think
        is not right at all, but I think I still learned a lot such as how to make navigations , styles in css, and others. Going back during the process that I did
        my website I realized some things like how to add background picture in the home page of my website, how to integrate css into html but honestly I already know how
        but I am still grateful for the teachings of our teacher because with her guidance I learned some things that i didn't know before, And my message for 
        my teacher is Thank you for your inspiring lessons on HTML and CSS! Your clear explanations and hands-on approach made learning how to create a web page both engaging and enjoyable. 
        We truly appreciate how you guided us through embedding CSS, incorporating multimedia, and building a functional menu bar navigation. Your passion for teaching
         shines through, and your patience in addressing our questions has made a significant impact. We feel more confident in our abilities to design and develop websites thanks to your support. 
         Thank you for being such an amazing teacher and for equipping us with these valuable skills.
